# Conception
The ConnectFour class is derived from the TicTacToe class and has an additional function that forces the player to operate only in the lowest empty cell of a column.
Implement the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees algorithm from the family of Monte Carlo tree search algorithms.
# Players
There are 3 types of players: the first one chooses his position randomly, the second one makes his choice based on the MCTS algorithm and the third one receives a list of available (legal) options for each move.
